# eLibrarian
This is team 11's software development project. Its a Librarian Assisstant program that will allow users to browse or take out the books of a library with their phones (or anything with access to a web browser).

Users will need to login in order to have access to the database of the library's books. If they don't have an account, they can create one. Once logged in, they can search through said database to find specific titles or authors, and they can either take out a book, or join the book's waitlist if it's borrowed already. Taking out a book will tell the user they have borrowed it, that it's available for pick up, and how long they have to return the book. Joining the waitlist will tell the user how many people are in front of them on the list, as well as a rough estimate of when the book should be available to rent. Librarian's will have an upgraded user account that will allow them to edit the library's stock in addition to the regular functions. Also, librarian's are the only account with the privilege to promote other accounts to a librarian account. User's should not only be able to see which waitlists they are on, but also which books they have borrowed or are due back on their account page. Here, they should be able to see their information, and edit their password as well.
